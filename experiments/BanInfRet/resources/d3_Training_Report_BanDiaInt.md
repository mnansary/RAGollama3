# Training Report for Sentence Transformer Model Fine-Tuning

## Executive Summary
This report details the fine-tuning process of a Sentence Transformer model (`l3cube-pune/bengali-sentence-similarity-sbert`) for semantic similarity tasks, conducted to support an investigation into the model's performance and training efficacy. The training was performed on a dataset aggregated from multiple sources, with a focus on reproducibility, efficiency, and robust evaluation. Key metrics, including evaluation scores and average cosine similarity, are presented to provide insight into the model's performance during training. The results indicate consistent performance, with evaluation scores stabilizing around 0.90–0.92 and an improving average cosine similarity, suggesting effective fine-tuning.

## Introduction
The objective of this training was to fine-tune a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model to enhance its ability to compute semantic similarity between Bengali text pairs, specifically for question-answering tasks. The training leveraged a curated dataset, optimized hyperparameters, and a structured evaluation process to ensure reliable outcomes. This report is prepared for the investigation committee to provide a comprehensive overview of the methodology, results, and implications of the training process.

## Methodology

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: `l3cube-pune/bengali-sentence-similarity-sbert`, a transformer-based model tailored for Bengali sentence similarity tasks.
- **Configuration**:
  - Maximum sequence length: 256 tokens.
  - Pooling strategy: Mean pooling of token embeddings.
  - Lower transformer layers were frozen to preserve pre-trained weights, while the last two layers were unfrozen for fine-tuning to adapt to the target task.
- **Device**: Training was conducted on a CUDA-enabled GPU to leverage hardware acceleration.

### Dataset
- **Sources**: Data was aggregated from three directories (`/home/vpa/deliverables/D2/BanQA/data`, `/home/vpa/deliverables/D3/BanQA/data`, `/home/vpa/deliverables/D4/BanQA/data`).
- **Training Samples**: 10,000 samples were generated, split into 90% training (9,000 samples) and 10% validation (1,000 samples).
- **Preprocessing**: The `generate_training_examples` function was used to create training examples, ensuring balanced and representative data. Validation data included query-passage pairs with associated similarity scores.
- **DataLoader**: Training data was batched with a batch size of 16, shuffled to ensure randomness.

### Training Configuration
- **Loss Function**: Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss (`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`), suitable for contrastive learning in semantic similarity tasks.
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Epochs: 1
  - Learning Rate: 1e-5
  - Warmup Steps: 100
  - Optimizer: AdamW (with mixed precision training enabled via `use_amp=True`)
- **Evaluation**:
  - Validation was performed every 281–282 steps (approximately half an epoch).
  - Metrics included:
    - **Evaluation Score**: Cosine similarity-based score from `EmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator`.
    - **Average Cosine Similarity**: Mean cosine similarity between query-passage pairs in the validation set.
- **Reproducibility**: A fixed seed (42) was set for PyTorch, NumPy, and random operations to ensure consistent results.

### Metrics Logging
- Metrics were logged at three checkpoints: mid-epoch (step 281), near the end of the epoch (step 562), and at epoch completion (step 563).
- Logs were saved to `training_metrics.json` in the model output directory (`./model_output`).

## Results

The training metrics are summarized below, extracted from the provided `training_metrics.json`:

| Timestamp             | Epoch  | Steps | Train Loss | Eval Score | Avg Cosine Similarity |
|-----------------------|--------|-------|------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 2025-05-14 09:49:11   | 0.499  | 281   | N/A        | 0.9220     | 0.5488                |
| 2025-05-14 09:49:34   | 0.998  | 562   | N/A        | 0.9037     | 0.5586                |
| 2025-05-14 09:49:45   | 1.000  | 563   | N/A        | 0.9037     | 0.5586                |

### Key Observations
1. **Evaluation Score**:
   - The evaluation score peaked at 0.9220 at step 281 (mid-epoch), indicating strong alignment between predicted and ground-truth similarities.
   - A slight decrease to 0.9037 was observed by the end of training (steps 562 and 563), suggesting possible overfitting or stabilization of model performance.
   - The final evaluation score of 0.9037 remains high, indicating robust performance on the validation set.

2. **Average Cosine Similarity**:
   - The average cosine similarity improved from 0.5488 at step 281 to 0.5586 by steps 562 and 563.
   - This upward trend suggests that the model learned to produce embeddings with better semantic alignment over the course of training.

3. **Train Loss**:
   - The training loss was not logged (`null` in metrics), which may indicate a configuration issue in the loss logging mechanism. Future iterations should address this to provide a complete picture of training dynamics.

4. **Training Duration**:
   - The timestamps indicate that training completed within approximately 34 seconds (from 09:49:11 to 09:49:45), reflecting efficient use of GPU resources and a relatively small dataset for one epoch.

## Discussion

### Performance Analysis
- The evaluation score of 0.9037–0.9220 is indicative of a well-performing model for semantic similarity tasks, particularly given the complexity of Bengali text processing.
- The slight drop in evaluation score from mid-epoch to the end may suggest that the model began to overfit to the training data or that the learning rate was not optimally decayed. However, the stable final score of 0.9037 suggests reliable generalization.
- The improvement in average cosine similarity (from 0.5488 to 0.5586) confirms that the fine-tuning process enhanced the model's ability to capture semantic relationships.

### Limitations
- **Single Epoch**: Training was limited to one epoch, which may not have allowed the model to fully converge. Additional epochs could potentially improve performance.
- **Missing Train Loss**: The absence of train loss metrics limits the ability to assess the optimization process. This should be rectified in future runs.
- **Dataset Size**: While 10,000 samples are substantial, a larger or more diverse dataset could further enhance model robustness.

### Recommendations
1. **Extend Training**: Conduct additional epochs (e.g., 3–5) with learning rate scheduling to explore whether further performance gains are achievable.
2. **Fix Loss Logging**: Modify the training script to ensure train loss is properly captured and logged for comprehensive monitoring.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates (e.g., 2e-5, 5e-5) and warmup steps to optimize convergence.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate additional data sources or augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity and improve generalization.
5. **Model Checkpointing**: Save intermediate model checkpoints to allow rollback to the best-performing model (e.g., at step 281 with eval score 0.9220).

## Conclusion
The fine-tuning of the `l3cube-pune/bengali-sentence-similarity-sbert` model was successful, achieving a high evaluation score (0.9037–0.9220) and demonstrating improved cosine similarity (0.5488 to 0.5586) over the course of training. The results indicate that the model is well-suited for semantic similarity tasks in Bengali text, though minor improvements in training configuration and logging could enhance future iterations. This report provides a transparent account of the process and outcomes for the investigation committee’s review.
